# Analysis of Ironhack Payments by cohorts

## **Introduction**

IronHack Payments, is a financial services company has been offering innovative cash advance solutions since its inception in 2020. With a commitment to providing free cash advances and transparent pricing, IronHack Payments has achieved a substantial user base. As part of its ongoing effort to improve its services and understand user behavior, IronHack Payments has commissioned a cohort analysis project.




## **Data Collection and Data Cleaning**

As a retrorespective study, the study has been provided with two datasets:
  1. Extract of cash requests (project_dataset\extract - cash request - data analyst.csv)
  2. Extract of fees (project_dataset\extract - fees - data analyst - .csv)

  *For description of columns, please check the glossary file (project_dataset\Lexique - Data Analyst.xlsx)
### - Overview of Raw Datasets

We have created heatmaps to visualizae the null data in each dataset - cash request(Figure 1) and fees (figure 2), *red* marks cells with null data while *green* marks those with values. At this stage, our focus is to analyze the meaning and impact of each collection of data thus engage with the next step of data cleaning.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2</b>

### - Data Types

Both datasets contain object and integer types of data, in order to facilitate furture analysis, we have transformed datas with the date&time format into datatime type in Python. The operation shows as following:

                df_fees[["created_at", "updated_at", "paid_at", "from_date", "to_date"]] = 
                    df_fees[["created_at", "updated_at", "paid_at", "from_date", "to_date"]].apply(pd.to_datetime, format="ISO8601")

### - Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values:

To address missing data in the above datasets, we have developed a strategy of replacing the empty cells with relevant data accordingly. As for cash request dataset, we have imputed the combination of 'status' and 'transfer_type' into the missing cells; and for fees dataset, missing cells are filled in depending on its 'type' and 'category' - if the missing cell is missing due to unapplicable condition, the cell is filled in with "not applicable"

The revenue graph aligns with the increased activity shown in the incident rate table, where activity is compared with the number of incidents.

### Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of tracking cohort-specific revenue and understanding the factors driving their performance. Identifying key cohorts and their characteristics can help in strategizing for better customer retention and revenue growth.

## 4.New metrics
### 4.1 **Incident Rate by Loan Type and Status**

In this section, we delve deeper into the incident rate observed in October 2020, aiming to investigate the cause and impact on the business. We analyzed the incident rate using months as cohorts and created graphs based on loan type (regular or instant) and loan status (accepted, rejected, cancelled, & confirmed). The goal is to identify which elements contribute most to the incident rate and how they affect revenue and the business's reputation.

![Incident Rate by Loan Type and Status](Resources/incident_type.png)

### Key Observations

1. **Overall Incident Rate**:
   - The incident rate showed a notable increase starting in June 2020, with a peak in October 2020.
   - Among the two loan types, "Regular" loans cause more incidents than "Instant" loans. The incident rate for "Regular" loans increased significantly from August 2020 to October 2020, suggesting a need to study and improve this loan type to reduce the incident rate.
   - In October 2020, there was an unprecedented number of "rejected" commissions and a significant decrease in "confirmed" commissions. This requires further investigation to determine whether it was due to a policy change or a system failure.

2. **Impact on Revenue and Business Image**:
   - The increase in incidents from June 2020 and the peak in October 2020 had a noticeable impact on the business.
   - The higher incident rate in "Regular" loans indicates potential issues that need addressing to maintain business image and customer satisfaction.

### Conclusion

Understanding the trends and causes of incidents, particularly in the "Regular" loan category, is crucial for improving service quality and maintaining a positive business reputation. Further investigation into the high number of rejected commissions in October 2020 is necessary to identify and rectify underlying issues.

## **Conclusion**

### Key findings

**Â· Retention rate:** 
notable increase in activity was observed during the months of June, July, and August.
Further investigation is required to identify the factors that contributed to this surge in activity during these months.

**Â· Incident rate:** the distribution and intensity of incidents over time, highlighting june,july and august.After then the incidents fall while the cash request increases. On May was included the instant payment.

**Â· Income by cohort:** Cohorts from June 2020, July 2020, and September 2020 have notably high revenues. Identifying the users in these cohorts is crucial as they are loyal customers with significant value. The income starts increasing in August after a decline, reaching its maximum value in October and generating the highest income.

**Â· Incident Rate by Loan Type and Status:** Among the two loan types, "Regular" loans cause more incidents than "Instant" loans. The incident rate for "Regular" loans increased significantly from August 2020 to October 2020, suggesting a need to study and improve this loan type to reduce the incident rate.Furthermore on October 2020, there was an unprecedented number of "rejected" commissions and a significant decrease in "confirmed" commissions. This requires further investigation to determine whether it was due to a policy change or a system failure.

**Â· Analysis of the Relationship Between Transfer Type and Income Generated:** The introduction of instant loans in May 2020 contributed positively to generated income, indicating that this service was well-adapted by clients.

**Â· Monthly Financial Analysis:** There is a notable positive trend in the income generated per dollar lent, with the peak appearing in the last month of the dataset.
Starting in May 2020, there is a sharp increase in efficiency, indicating that the company has become more effective in utilizing capital to generate income from this month onward.



- Conclusion

We can conclude that the company has experienced an increase in retention, particularly during the months of June, July, and August. This period also saw a rise in activity, which correlated with an increase in incidents. However, the incidents are not directly related to the increase in activity, as a future scenario shows that an increase in activity can lead to a decrease in total incidents. These incidents could involve money or debit issues.

In terms of revenue, it is evident that the company has increased its income since the incorporation of instant payments. The instant payment service has proven to be highly beneficial for the enterprise, as its implementation has significantly boosted revenue. Despite the increase in incidents associated with this new payment method, the overall revenue has grown substantially compared to regular payments.

The same positive impact is demonstrated in the ROI per dollar lent. There is a notable positive trend in the income generated per dollar lent, with the peak appearing in the last month of the dataset. Starting in May 2020, there has been a sharp increase in efficiency, indicating that the company has become more effective in utilizing capital to generate income from this month onward.

In summary, the introduction of instant payments has been advantageous for the company, enhancing both revenue and efficiency, despite the accompanying increase in incidents. This suggests that further focus on optimizing instant payments and mitigating related incidents could drive even greater business success.
